# Summary

This is a low cost, low power bar robot project. There are many here on Thingiverse already but these require air compressors, mains voltages and have Bill of Materials that run into the hundreds of Â£'s or $'s.

This design has most of it's parts 3D printed. Is designed to run from a USB battery pack and some AA batteries. (Keeps the power levels safe which is important when working with liquids and allows you to take the machine to parties, the garden or beaches with relative ease).

If you make your own one I would love to see it. :)

A video guide on assembly is available here: 
Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBvXknwVfaI
Part 2: https://youtu.be/0t-JTVYdE7s
Part 3: https://youtu.be/x-PyuDoUlU8
Part 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvOpvPKHJvc 

I also used the following models created by others:
To hold the Arduino: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33327
For the drag chain: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11978

The threaded rods and paddle threads we're made using this thingy: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:193647

You can find the Arduino code here: http://diymachines.co.uk/?p=62

UPDATE 12/01/2018:

I've been asked to slice up the main slider base so it might be printed on a smaller print bed. I've uploaded files 'Slider Base V3 - P1of2' and Slider Base V3 - P2of2'. I've not had chance to test these so if you do print and assemble them without issue please let me know so I can update this. Thanks
